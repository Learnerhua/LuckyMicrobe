#This file describes how to natively install the softwares that need in this pipeline.

##1.Installing the package management software(miniconda/anconda) if you have none of them.
###Taking the miniconda3 as example.
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
source $HOME/.bashrc
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/cloud/bioconda/
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/cloud/conda-forge/

##2.Installing the Qiime2 under the conda environment.
###Running the commands as follows:
conda update conda
wget https://data.qiime2.org/distro/core/qiime2-2022.2-py38-linux-conda.yml
conda env create -n qiime2-2022.2 --file qiime2-2022.2-py38-linux-conda.yml
### OPTIONAL CLEANUP
rm qiime2-2022.2-py38-linux-conda.yml
conda activate qiime2-2022.2
###To deactivate an environment, run:
conda deactivate.
###You can test your installation by activating your QIIME 2 environment and running:
qiime --help
###If no errors are reported when running this command, the installation was successful.
###Brief command:
wget https://data.qiime2.org/distro/core/qiime2-2022.2-py38-linux-conda.yml && conda env create -n qiime2-2022.2 --file qiime2-2022.2-py38-linux-conda.yml && conda activate qiime2-2022.2 && qiime --help

##3.Installing the usearch.
###USEARCH is distributed as one file, known as the binary file or executable file. It is completely self-contained: it does not require configuration files, environment variables, third-party libraries or other external dependencies. There is no setup script or installer because they're not needed. To install it, all you do is download or copy the binary to a directory that is accessible from the computer where you want to run the code.Here, we run the codes as follows:
wget https://drive5.com/downloads/usearch11.0.667_i86linux32.gz
gunzip usearch11.0.667_i86linux32.gz
###The uncompressed binary file must be in one of the directories specified in your PATH variable, for example, you can move it to the directory "/usr/bin"(but you need to own the permission to enter the directory such as command "sudo")
mv usearch11.0.667_i86linux32 /usr/bin
cd /usr/bin
chmod +x usearch11.0.667_i86linux32
###Changing the name of the binary file then you can run the command easier.
mv usearch11.0.667_i86linux32 usearch
###Then you can test your installation by running:
usearch
###If no errors are reported when running this command, the installation was successful.
###Brief command:
wget https://drive5.com/downloads/usearch11.0.667_i86linux32.gz && gunzip usearch11.0.667_i86linux32.gz && mv usearch11.0.667_i86linux32 /usr/bin && cd /usr/bin && chmod +x usearch11.0.667_i86linux32 && mv usearch11.0.667_i86linux32 usearch && usearch

##4.Installing the LEfSe
conda install lefse=1.1.2 -c bioconda -y
