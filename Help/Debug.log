##Some questions may be occured when you use this pipeline.
##Here are some tips to solve these problems:

###1.About installing the lefse software.
When you install the lefse software use the command like "conda install lefse", an incompatible error maybe occured.then you can solve the problem by specifying the version "conda install lefse=1.1.2";
What's more,relatede mirrors must be added to your conda enviroment or conda can not find the correct package.
Commands can be excuted just like this:
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/cloud/bioconda/
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/cloud/conda-forge/

###2.About the PATH variable.
You should put the position of your work environment path prior to other paths in the PATH variable before running the pipeline.
